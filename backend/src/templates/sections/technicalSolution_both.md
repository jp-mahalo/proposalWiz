# Technical Solution - Web & Mobile Application

This section details the proposed technical solution for the combined **Web and Mobile Application**.

**Web Application:**
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, utilizing MUI components.
- Backend: Node.js with NestJS framework.
- Database: PostgreSQL.

**Mobile Application:**
Platforms: {{#if step1.mobilePlatforms}} {{join step1.mobilePlatforms ", "}} {{else}} Not Specified {{/if}}
- We recommend native development (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) for the best user experience and performance. Cross-platform options (React Native, Flutter) can be discussed.

The unified backend will serve both web and mobile applications, ensuring data consistency and efficient development.
Deployment will be on {{step5.deploymentEnvironmentName}}.
{{#if step5.preferredRegion}}
The preferred deployment region is {{step5.preferredRegion}}.
{{/if}}
