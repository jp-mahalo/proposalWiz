# Technical Solution - Web Application

This section details the proposed technical solution for the **Web Application**.

We recommend a modern technology stack:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, utilizing MUI components (as per wizard setup).
- Backend: Node.js with NestJS framework (as per wizard setup).
- Database: PostgreSQL (as per wizard setup).

Key architectural considerations will include scalability, security, and maintainability. We will focus on {{step5.deploymentEnvironmentName}} for deployment.
{{#if step5.preferredRegion}}
The preferred deployment region is {{step5.preferredRegion}}.
{{/if}}
