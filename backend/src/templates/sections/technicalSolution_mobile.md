This section details the proposed technical solution for the **Mobile Application**.

Platforms: {{#if step1.mobilePlatforms}} {{join step1.mobilePlatforms ", "}} {{else}} Not Specified {{/if}}

We recommend native development for optimal performance and user experience:
- iOS: Swift
- Android: Kotlin

Alternatively, a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter can be considered based on budget and specific feature requirements.

The backend will be developed using Node.js with NestJS, and PostgreSQL database, deployed on {{step5.deploymentEnvironmentName}}.
{{#if step5.preferredRegion}}
The preferred deployment region is {{step5.preferredRegion}}.
