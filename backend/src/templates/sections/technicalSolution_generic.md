# Technical Solution

This section outlines the proposed technical solution. The specific technologies will be chosen based on the final agreed scope and platform (Web, Mobile, or Both).

Our general approach involves:
- Robust backend services, likely using Node.js with NestJS.
- Scalable database solution, such as PostgreSQL.
- Modern frontend technologies tailored to the application type.
